# GUI_ClientSide
Here will be all the client side scripts code.
Basic rules: 
Here will be all the client-side scripts code and on. 
Some basic rules: all the design images or files that are not a code should be stored in a separate folder. 
All the code that is committed to the main branch should be final and approved by the main developer (Valery), no changes can be done without it. 
Code which is not final should be stored in a brunch. 
There will be only three brunches: one for each developer and the main one for temporary code. For the small things USE YOUR OWN PC. 
Plz don't edit this file without informing me, thx.
